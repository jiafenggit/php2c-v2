PHP to C converter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PHP2C is a PHP to C converter that can be used to improve your
productivity when writing more complicated PHP extensions in C. With
PHP2C you can simply describe classes, interfaces and global functions
in PHP language and PHP2C will generate skeleton of your new PHP
extension.

PHP2C supports classes, interfaces, methods, functions, properties,
default values and also prefills the implementations of functions and
methods with some basic parameter parsing and checking.

The code is fairly complete and useful.

Installation/use:

- Extract
- Explore
- Run test.sh
- Write the extension interface in PHP
- And then do the real hard stuff instead of wasting your time writing
  boilerplate code.

How you can help to improve the application:

- Feel free to create branches in the project's repository on GITHUB or send me
  patches or pull requests for your changes.
